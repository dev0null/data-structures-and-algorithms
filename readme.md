# Data structures - Introduction
Data structures are specialized formats for organizing, processing, retrieving, and storing data efficiently.

They are fundamental building blocks in computer programming, defining` how data is organized, stored, and manipulated within a program, during the execution time`.

Different types of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications and tasks

Data structures can be divided in two categories:
- **Physical Data Structure**: define how the data is arranged inside the memory.

- **Logical Data Structure**: define the data arrangement and how should be utilized.

### 1 - Physical Data Structure
Define how the data is arranged inside the memory. It deals with how data is stored, accessed, and managed at the hardware level.

Examples include:
- **Arrays** (contiguous memory allocation).
- **Linked Lists** (nodes with data and pointers to memory addresses).

### 2 - Logical Data Structure
Defines the abstract model of organizing data based on usage and relationships, independent of physical implementation. It specifies what operations can be performed and how data is conceptually related.

Examples include:
- **Stacks** (LIFO: Last-In-First-Out).
- **Queues** (FIFO: First-In-First-Out).
- **Trees** (hierarchical relationships) and Graphs (nodes and edges).
Focus: User perspective, ease of manipulation, and logical behavior (e.g., insertion, deletion, traversal).
